# What is IssueHunt?

IssueHunt is an issue-based bounty platform for open source projects.

IssueHunt offers a service that pays freelance developers for contributing to open-source code. We do it through what is called bounties: financial rewards granted to whoever solves a given problem. The funding for these bounties comes from anyone who is willing to donate to have any given bug fixed or feature added.

Much popular open-source software such as [AntDesign](https://issuehunt.io/repos/34526884) and [Jekyll](https://issuehunt.io/repos/65252) are using IssueHunt.

Initially, we made IssueHunt for contributors of our project [Boostnote](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote). We’ve got over 12k+ GitHub stars in two years and hundreds of contributors.

At first, we made a prototype of IssueHunt as a bounty program for the Boostnote community. As a result, many issues resolved in a few days and our community has boosted!

From our use-case we’ve realized IssueHunt could improve the sustainability of the open-source ecosystem overall.

## Mission

We organized IssueHunt with a simple mission in mind: to create a sustainable open source ecosystem.

We think enthusiastic open source developers are not appropriately rewarded no matter how much they contribute to the technology evolution.

Many leading projects use open-source software, but no matter how they are essential, the owners of those projects juggle multiple jobs to sustain their living.

We want to fix this situation by nurturing a healthy open-source ecosystem.
